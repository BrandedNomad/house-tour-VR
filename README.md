# Virtual Reality House Tour

A VR house showing.

## Motivation

My first VR application. I wanted to explore Virtual Reality using React.

## Tech/Framework Used

Build with:
* React-360

## Features

* buttons that allow you to explore different rooms
* Ambient music control
* 360 view of each room

## Installation

1.Fork and clone 

`git clone https://github.com/BrandedNomad/house-tour-VR.git`

2.Install dependencies

`npm install`

3.(For Widows Users) Manually update the regular expression in node_modules/metro/src/blacklist.js, otherwise you will get an error when you try to start the development server.

from:

`
var sharedBlacklist = [
/node_modules[/\\]react[/\\]dist[/\\].*/,
/website\/node_modules\/.*/,
/heapCapture\/bundle\.js/,
/.*\/__tests__\/.*/];
`

To: 

`
var sharedBlacklist = [
  /node_modules[\/\\]react[\/\\]dist[\/\\].*/,
  /website\/node_modules\/.*/,
  /heapCapture\/bundle\.js/,
  /.*\/__tests__\/.*/
];
`


3.Start development server

`npm start`

4.Navigate to browser, using the link provided in the console

Select the room you would like to see, and click and drag your mouse within the browser to get a 360 view of the room. (No need for VR headset)
